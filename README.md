# SignalWire Assessment - Node.js and Browser SDK

### Packages

This package provides a WebSocket Client that connects to a simple WebSocket Server (https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester) that echos back the same message content that it receives.

**NOTE: You may run into unsolicited incoming messages from the WebSocket Server as it is a shared open resource and many developers are given the same API key.

Refer to the README of each package for further details. Currently, there are two (browser and Node.js) packages that execute these functions.
